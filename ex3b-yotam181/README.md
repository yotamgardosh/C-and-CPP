### Introduction
This is the etend of exercise 3A, which I have completed in Huji's Programming Workshop in C & C++ course.
The primary goal of this project is to generalize the tweet generation algorithm to work with a generic data type, rather than being limited to a specific text source. This allows the user to apply the algorithm to any type of data, and generate new content based on the patterns and probabilities found within that data. Overall, this project seeks to expand the versatility and utility of the original tweet generation algorithm.
