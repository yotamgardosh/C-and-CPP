# Project 3A - Tweet Generation using Markov Chains (NLP)
This project aims to generate tweets by using Markov Chains, which are constructed based on the probability of adjacent words in a given text source. By leveraging these probabilities, the project is designed to make it easy to create interesting tweets with minimal effort from the user.
