### Introduction
This is the first exercise I have completed in Huji's Programming Workshop in C & C++ course.
The primary objective of this exercise is to provide the learner with a foundational understanding of the Caesar Cipher, as well as the fundamental principles of programming in the C language.
The Caesar cipher is a simple substitution cipher that shifts the letters of the alphabet by a certain number of positions to create a new ciphertext. 
The implementation of this project would involve taking input from the user, applying the cipher algorithm to the text, and outputting the encrypted or decrypted message.
