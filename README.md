# Projects-in-C-and-C-languages
As a student of Computer Science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, I was required to take the Programming Workshop in C & C++ course. This course aims to teach fundamental and advanced concepts of Memory Management, Object-Oriented Programming, and Generic Programming, employing C & C++ as the primary programming languages. Additional details about the course can be found on this [link](#https://shnaton.huji.ac.il/index.php/NewSyl/67315/2/2022/).
